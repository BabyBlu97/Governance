The ballots are collected for a minimum of a forty-eight hour period.
A quorum of two-thirds of the Total Number of Possible Votes must cast ballots for the vote to be official.
A vote equaling or exceeding two-thirds of the number of votes cast is required for the change to be placed into the constitution.
The Constitution may be overridden by an immediate House vote as described in \ref{Immediate Vote}.
